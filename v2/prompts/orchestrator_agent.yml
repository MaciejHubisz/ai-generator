  You are designing the backend architecture for a new Spring Boot application.

  OBJECTIVE:
  Create a full context for generating a backend that only exposes the following endpoint(s):

  - `GET /healthcheck` — should return a 200 OK with a health message, only if the database is reachable.

  RULES:
  - Only include the exact endpoint listed above.
  - Do not add other REST endpoints, features, or services.
  - Use conventional Java package naming and Spring Boot structure.
  - The application must follow layered architecture: Controller → Service → Repository.
  - The Repository must attempt a real DB query (e.g., `SELECT 1`) to verify connectivity.
  - The Service must catch the repository-level exception and throw its own custom exception.
  - Custom exception must be generic e.g. BusinessException, but find better generic name
  - The Controller must handle the service-level exception and return a meaningful HTTP error using `ResponseEntity`.
  - Exceptions must be clearly named and described for each layer.

  You must generate the following context files:

  - `context/springboot_context.txt`:
      PACKAGE: base package for the app (e.g., com.example.health)
      CONFIG_PACKAGE: where to put @Configuration classes
      MAIN_CLASS: name of the Spring Boot app class
      PROPERTIES: key=value Spring Boot config entries

  - `context/controller_context.txt`:
      PACKAGE: where controller classes will be placed
      ENDPOINTS: list of endpoint definitions (e.g., GET /healthcheck)
      SERVICE_CALLS: controller → service method mapping (e.g., HealthService.checkHealth())
      EXCEPTION_HANDLING:
        - Which exception(s) controller handles
        - How to map exceptions to HTTP responses using ResponseEntity

  - `context/service_context.txt`:
      PACKAGE: where service classes will be placed
      SERVICE_CLASSES: name(s) of service classes
      METHODS: for each service, what methods exist with signatures, return types, and descriptions
      REPOSITORY_CALLS: what repository method(s) the service invokes
      EXCEPTION_HANDLING:
        - Which repository exceptions are caught
        - What custom exception the service throws in response

  - `context/repository_context.txt`:
      PACKAGE: where repository classes will be placed
      CHECK_METHOD: method signature for verifying DB connection (e.g., boolean pingDatabase())
      IMPLEMENTATION_HINT: how to implement DB check (e.g., using JdbcTemplate.queryForObject)
      EXCEPTION_TYPE: custom exception thrown if DB connection check fails

  - `context/openapi_controller.txt`: full OpenAPI 3.0 YAML for just the defined REST endpoint

  FORMAT:
  Output each file using this exact format:

  ### BEGIN FILE: context/<filename>.txt
  <content>
  ### END FILE

  Do not output anything else.
