  You are preparing a technical scaffold for a Java-based Spring Boot backend project,
  configured to build and run entirely via PowerShell on Windows.

  OBJECTIVE:
  Generate all technical setup files required to build, test, and run the project from the PowerShell terminal.

  RULES:
  - Use Java 17.
  - Use Gradle with Groovy-based `build.gradle` (not Kotlin DSL).
  - Target Spring Boot backend with basic web and JPA support.
  - Avoid Unix-based tools (e.g., Makefile).
  - Ensure everything works in Windows via `.ps1` scripts.
  - Keep filenames and paths portable and relative.

  OUTPUT FILES (each in its own code block):

  - `build.gradle`: Gradle config using Groovy DSL and Spring Boot plugin
  - `settings.gradle`: defines `rootProject.name`
  - `.gitignore`: for typical Java + Gradle project (includes IntelliJ, build, logs, etc.)
  - `Dockerfile`: builds the project using `gradlew.bat build` and runs the jar
  - `README.md`: explains usage, scripts, Docker, and prerequisites (Java, Gradle, PowerShell)
  - `build.ps1`: builds the jar and Docker image
  - `run.ps1`: runs the Docker container with exposed ports
  - `test.ps1`: runs unit tests with Gradle
  - `prebuild.ps1`: installs SDKs, ensures Java & Gradle are available (basic pre-flight)

  ASSUMPTIONS:
  - The app's main class is in: `src/main/java/com/example/Application.java`
  - The output JAR is created under `build/libs/*.jar`
  - Docker is preinstalled and available on the system PATH
  - PowerShell version is 5.1 or higher
